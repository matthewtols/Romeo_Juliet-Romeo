		<p class="p"><img src="images/benvolio-etc-analysis-crop.jpg" alt="Fight" height="200" style="float: right; padding: 20px;">
			This is possibly the most important scene so far in this whole book. It is the first twhole seen in
			which Romeo and Juliet are married but it is also when tragedy strikes. A fiesty young man named Tybalt, of
			the house of Capulet, saw Romeo at the party he had gone to to meet Juliet. As he had not been allowed to
			fight Romeo then and there, he sends a letter to Romeo which appears in this scene. The letter is
			challenging Romeo to a fight, a duel. His friends recieve the letter and, eager to be active, accept the
			duel themselves. During the duel, Romeo arrives and steps between the two people. Tybalt stabs Romeo's
			friend Mercutio from under Romeo's arm and runs. Romeo cleans up the mess before Tybalt returns, and this
			time, Romeo duels Tybalt. Tybalt dies. Romeo then leaves and the citizens of Verona enter. They see Tybalt
			lying there and call the Prince. The Prince asks what happens and, as Romeo was avenging someone, he was
			banished instead of killed.</p>
		<h3 class="p">Scene 2</h3>
		<p class="p">Romeo is merely discussed by Juliet and her Nurse.</p>
		<h3 class="p">Scene 3</h3>
		<p class="p">Romeo is hiding in Friar Lawrences Cell. He is distressed by what he has done and is telling this
			to the Friar. Juliets Nurse then comes and tells Romeo that Juliet has accepted this and that she is more
			sad that Romeo is banished than that Romeo killed Tybalt. By the time the scene ends, Romeo is happy again.
		</p>

		<p class="p">Romeo does not appear in this scene.</p>
		<h3 class="p">Scene 5</h3>

			Juliet's Nurse who warns them that Capulet and Lady Capulet are coming. Romeo then exits the scene. This is
